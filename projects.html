            <p>One of my most recent projects was over the summer.  I started quilting.  I used the triangle quilt as a practice one to learn some of
                the basics of sewing.  Then once I had a grasp on that, I took a bunch of my brother's high school t-shirts and began working on a quilt for him.
                It took many hours and lots of work.  It was awesome to see the finished project!

            <p>Another project I have done was at my internship over the summer.  I worked on a digital ticketing platform called ServiceNow. The goal of the project was to 
                see how we could improve the performance of this platform.  I, along with the other interns on my team, ran various tests to see what was causing the slowdowns. 
                We found it was due to many of the outdated customizations.  Once we figured this out, we did various user stories to update the customizations.

            <h1>Project 3 - Desk</h1>
            <img src="images/desk.JPG" alt="desk"/>
            <p>Another project I worked on over the summer was redoing my desk.  It was old and scratched up, so I wanted something nicer.  I cleaned the desk and stripped off the paint.  Then 
                I painted the bottom part white and stained the top darker.  To finish, I replaced the handles.</p>
