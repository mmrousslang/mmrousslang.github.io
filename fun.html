            <p>One of my favorite things to do is to play games.  The board to one of my favorite games is pictured above.  It is called Carbles and is similar to Sorry or Aggravation.
                It can be played with as little as 2 people and as many as 6.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQybLanJo94" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to 
                a video explaining how to play.

            <p>Here are a couple of pictures of my dog Winston!  He loves going on walks and playing tennis.  There is also a video of him trying to jump up on the couch.  He is a maltipoo and is 3 years old.</p>
            <h1>Baking</h1>
            <p>I've always loved baking and over the last few months have been baking lots!</p>

                <img src="images/rolls.jpg" alt="bread rolls"/>
                <p>One of my goals was to figure out how to make the delicious rolls from Texas Roadhouse.  After <i>lots</i> of trial and error, I finally
                    found the perfect recipe.<a href="https://newsronian.com/texas-roadhouses-rolls-with-honey-cinnamon-butter/" target="_blank">  Here</a> is the link!

                <h2>Cheesecake</h2>
                <img src="images/cheesecake.jpg" alt="cheesecake"/>
                <p>Whenever I needed a break from baking rolls, I tried out some different cheesecake recipes.  I made a lemon cheesecake, a coffee cheesecake, and a salted caramel one.  They were all delicious!</p>
